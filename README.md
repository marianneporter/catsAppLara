# Laravel Cats App

## Technologies used:
Laravel
PHP
mySQL/Eloquent
HTML/CSS/JavaScript
Tailwind

## Design / Development Notes
Laravel 9 app based on my original PHP app written last year.

This app has full authentication and uses Laravel Pagination.  Tailwind is used for styling alongside some custom CSS.  The app is fully responsive across screen sizes.

I have used Laravel components in my design. They eliminate long html files and duplication of logic.  The add-edit component is used for both create and edit functionality, it uses general purpose form element components for inputs, selects and the datepicker.  My authentication forms were very quick to produce having already made the form elements for add-update.

Vanilla JavaScript is used on the front end to make the form more dynamic and also for messaging.  While developing the app I particularly enjoyed using JavaScript as I enjoy seeing my apps become more interactive with user input.
